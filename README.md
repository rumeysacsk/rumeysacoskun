I am a new graduate from Iztech Computer Engineering Department. I've started a new position as a Software Engineer at Vestel. I am curious about analyzing and processing big data and making decisions based on the work. And I want to build my career in the field of data science, so I am excited about the first task that'll be assigned to me in about 3 or 4 weeks.. Currently I am working on various topics to adapt my new role quickly, including linux, git, python, sql, golang, bigquery, terraform, gcp and so on.
